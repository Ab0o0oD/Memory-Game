# Schmemory(Memory) Game

This is a card game where pairs of cards contain images, such that for each card, there is exactly one other card with the same image. The cards are placed face-down on a surface. A player chooses any two cards and flips them face-up. If the images match, they will stay face-up â€” otherwise they should be flipped back. This continues until all cards are face-up.

# Schmemory example

This is an unfinished example implementation of the schmemory game to help you get started. It includes babel, sass, webpack and webpack-dev-server, but you are not required to touch those.
The javascript is in a class-based es5 syntax, but you do not need to adhere to this when you are adding your own code.

*You may add, refactor and re-arrange code, but you shouldn't remove any of it. Base your solution on the provided code.*

## The initial code consists of the following files:

- ``src/index.html`` contains the html.
- ``src/scripts/index.js`` contains the javascript code.
- ``src/styles/index.scss`` contains the styles.
- The ``example-image-server`` folder contains a simple image server that generates and serves images, but you can ignore that for now. 

# Prerequisites
You will need Node installed on your machine for this project to work. You can download that here if you don't have it installed already: https://nodejs.org/en/ (Choose the LTS version). 

# Running

In the root of this directory, open a terminal/command-line(View->Terminal in most IDEs) and run the following: 
1. ``npm install`` : (First time only) Installs the required npm packages the example image server and the client
2. ``npm run start-all``: Runs the image-server and the client simultaneously
This will also auto-reload your project when you save any changes made. Only ``npm run start-all`` is required after the first time if you stop or close the project.

Once it is running the game should open automatically in a browser (if not you can view it by opening http://localhost:3001/). Note that it will initially display 4 cards, but it is not possible to click them yet.
# Tasks
First you need to complete the TODO-comments in ``src/scripts/index.js``. They are numbered in the recommended order. After completing 1 & 2 you should be able to test flipping your cards by clicking them in the browser.

There are a lot of areas you can choose to focus on after you've implemented the basic functionality if you have more time! Here is a list of suggestions (You are only supposed to do one or two of these)
1. Improve/fix gameplay. (there are still a number of things that could be fixed and improve to play the game as expected) 
2. Points, timers, scoreboards
3. Responsive design
4. UI elements like buttons, tooltips, end- and error-states
5. Accessibility 
6. Fancy look and feel
7. Adding your own images and an extra endpoint to serve them from

*Remember that you should not spend more than 3 hours on this project at the most.*
## What did you focus on?
- Please add a list here of the ideas you tried to implement. Optionally add a sentence or two about what you would improve further if you had more time.
